# Crime Analysis README

## Overview
This project conducts an analysis of crime data to derive insights regarding crime occurrence patterns. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to answer specific questions related to crime frequencies by hour, location, and victim age groups.

## Project Structure
- `crime_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis.
- `crimes.csv`: Dataset containing crime records.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Open `crime_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run each cell sequentially to execute the code.

## Dataset
The dataset (`crimes.csv`) contains records of reported crimes, including the date, time, location, victim details, and crime description.

## Analysis
### 1. Peak Crime Hour
Identifies the hour with the highest frequency of crimes.

### 2. Peak Night Crime Location
Determines the area with the largest frequency of crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am.

### 3. Victim Age Analysis
Identifies the number of crimes committed against victims by age group.

## Results
- **Peak Crime Hour:** Most crimes occur at midnight.
- **Peak Night Crime Location:** The area with the largest volume of night crime is identified.
- **Victim Age Analysis:** The distribution of crimes by age group is provided.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into crime patterns, which can aid in resource allocation and crime prevention strategies.
